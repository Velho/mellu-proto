Sqlite (On windows)
    Sqlite is distributed as .def and .dll. Move the DLL into
    binary folder and create .lib with the following command for linkage.

    lib /DEF:"C:\SQLite\sqlite3.def" /OUT:"C:\SQLite\sqlite3.lib"

Boost
    Boost is linked as static library but it requires following as compiled libraries
    system, program_options, filesystem. Tested with boost version 1.55, 1.56 and 1.57.

SFML
