TODO
    - Dropping mechanic
        -> Questions yet to be answered
            -> Is the same GameObject class used to handle this mechanic with its own Components?
            -> GameObject to one drop or many drops in one GameObject?
            -> If the GameObject handles all drops for current Event, they can be mapped
               into Event class which handles everything else(Dequeue or multiple events at same time, etc)?
        -> Maaaany questions.
    - Player placeholder
        -> Simple physics.
        -> Graphics. 
            -> View object is controlled in PlayerGraphicsComponent.
               Y axis not implemented(fix). PlrGraphicsComponent doesnt
               draw anything but player, everything else that leaves out of the
               window must be considered as unvisible and not drawn on screen(IMPORTANT => class World?).

LOW PRIO
    - Move map drawing to World class so that only visible objects are drawn to screen.
    - Framerate is limited to  60 frames which makes everything for me as developer easier
      but for user experience setting up their own framerate is crucial.
      Every PlayerState is calculated against fixed values which work in current setup but releasing
      the framerate brakes the program. => CALCULATE AGAINST CLOCK.
DONE
    -> Map editing on runtime. (--edit flag is required)
