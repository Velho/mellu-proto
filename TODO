TODO
    - Dropping mechanic
        -> Questions yet to be answered
            -> Is the same GameObject class used to handle this mechanic with its own Components?
            -> GameObject to one drop or many drops in one GameObject?
            -> If the GameObject handles all drops for current Event, they can be mapped
               into Event class which handles everything else(Dequeue or multiple events at same time, etc)?
        -> Maaaany questions.
    - Player placeholder
        -> Simple physics.
        -> Graphics. 
            -> View object is controlled in PlayerGraphicsComponent.
               Y axis not implemented(fix). PlrGraphicsComponent doesnt
               draw anything but player, everything else that leaves out of the
               window must be considered as unvisible and not drawn on screen(IMPORTANT => class World?).
DONE
    -> Map editing on runtime. (--edit flag is required)
